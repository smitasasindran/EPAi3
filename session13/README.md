#### Goal 1

Create a lazy iterator that will return a named tuple of the data in each row. The data types should be appropriate - i.e. if the column is a date, you should be storing dates in the named tuple, if the field is an integer, then it should be stored as an integer, etc.

#### Goal 2

Calculate the number of violations by car make.   

Note:
Try to use lazy evaluation as much as possible - it may not always be possible though! That's OK, as long as it's kept to a minimum.
